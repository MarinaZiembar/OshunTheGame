# OshunTheGame
-This project is a short text-game, based on a character that a friend and I had to develop for "Graphic Design I" final project, (a UBA FADU core subject). 
<br>-The purpose of this game is to expand the character's universe by bringing it to life and exploring some aspects of its personality, backstory and superpowers.
<br>-Language: spanish. (4 now)  
<br>-A special mention to Sol Fusco, who is nothing less than the other half of this awesome team and did an amazing job with the design and creation of the characters, backgrounds and much more â™¥
